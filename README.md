# Metric/Imperial Unit Converter

This project is a unit converter built based on a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/UE9rMlbkbbOn6sfrb2O7vI/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0-13&t=KUJqCTCnUOACAYQd-0). You can view the live project [here](https://unit-conventer1.netlify.app/).

## About The Project

I first recreated the design with HTML and CSS to create a pixel-perfect user interface that is faithful to the Figma design. Then, I added core functionality with JavaScript to handle the unit conversion logic. This allows the application to automatically convert length, volume, and mass units based on the number you enter.

### Features
* **HTML & CSS**: A user-friendly interface that matches the Figma design.
* **JavaScript**: Functions to convert between Metric and Imperial units for length (meters/feet), volume (liters/gallons), and mass (kilograms/pounds).
